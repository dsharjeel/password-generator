        Most humbly, I am writing this email concerning the available opportunity for a remote internship at {comp_name}.
        My name is Danish Sharjeel and I am a first-year student of BS Computer Science. I recently started looking for
        Data Analyst internships and saw your company website {comp_link} listed as a Big Data/AI solution tech company hence I'm
        emailing for an open opportunity as Remote Data Science Intern.
        <br/><br/>
        With best regards,<br/>
        Danish Sharjeel
        </p>
